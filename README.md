# Project-Artevelde GentseFeesten
Reimagined the magic! Rebuilt a past website for Ghent's iconic Gentse Feesten festival using programming skills. Explored improvements in design, responsiveness, and potentially new features like interactive maps or artist schedules. A project to bridge the gap between theory and real-world web development!

## Gentse Feesten Website Revamp: A Hands-On Learning Journey (Artevelde UAS Project)

As a programming student at Artevelde University of Applied Sciences, I embarked on a project that brought the magic of Ghent's Gentse Feesten festival to life online. My mission? To revamp a past website for this iconic event, diving deep into the world of web development and exploring ways to enhance its design, functionality, and user experience â€“ all without relying on pre-built frameworks.

**Building from the Ground Up**

This project allowed me to solidify my understanding of the core technologies that power websites:

* **HTML:** I became the architect of the website, structuring the content and defining the layout using HTML.
* **CSS:** I transformed the website from a blueprint into a visually engaging experience by styling its appearance with CSS.
* **JavaScript (Optional):**  For a touch of interactivity, I could have integrated JavaScript. This could involve features like image carousels for showcasing festival highlights, countdowns to key events, or simple animations to add flair.

**Tailoring the Experience**

The project scope allowed me to delve into different aspects, depending on the chosen past Gentse Feesten website and my learning goals. Here are some areas I could focus on:

* **Design and Layout Revamp:** I meticulously recreated the visual elements and user interface of the original website, while also exploring opportunities to make it shine brighter. This could involve modernizing the aesthetic, improving the organization of information, or ensuring the website seamlessly adapts to different devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) for a smooth user experience across platforms.
* **Enhanced Responsiveness:** Making sure the website adjusts flawlessly to various screen sizes was a priority. This could involve implementing responsive design techniques with pure CSS media queries.
* **New Feature Exploration:**  The project offered a creative space to experiment with adding functionalities that might not have existed before, all using vanilla JavaScript. This could include an interactive map highlighting festival stages and food vendors, an artist schedule with clickable links to artist information pages, or even a simple search bar to navigate the website's content.
* **Content Management System (CMS) Integration (Optional):** For larger projects, I could have delved into developing a basic CMS with plain HTML and PHP. This allows for easy updates to the website's content without requiring code changes, making it simpler for festival organizers to maintain the website.

**Learning by Doing**

By recreating a real-world website for the beloved Gentse Feesten, I gained invaluable hands-on experience in web development.  Here are some key areas where my knowledge grew:

* **Website Design Principles:** I grasped the core principles of effective website design, encompassing user interface (UI) design, information architecture, and visual hierarchy.
* **Front-End Development Techniques:** Transforming theory into practice, I implemented HTML and CSS, and potentially JavaScript, to create a functional and visually appealing website without relying on pre-built frameworks. This fostered a deeper understanding of the underlying technologies.
* **Website Responsiveness and User Experience (UX):** I learned to design websites that adapt seamlessly to different devices while prioritizing user experience by ensuring the website is easy to navigate and interact with.
* **(Optional) Content Management Systems:** Gaining experience with integrating a basic CMS fostered an understanding of how websites can be efficiently maintained and updated.

This project at Artevelde UAS wasn't just about code; it was about bridging the gap between theory and real-world application. It provided a valuable opportunity to explore the creative and technical aspects of website creation while contributing to the vibrant online presence of the renowned Gentse Feesten festival.
