# ProjectArtevelde-GentseFeesten
Reimagined the magic! Rebuilt a past website for Ghent's iconic Gentse Feesten festival using programming skills. Explored improvements in design, responsiveness, and potentially new features like interactive maps or artist schedules. A project to bridge the gap between theory and real-world web development!
